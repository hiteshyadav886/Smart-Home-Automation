🔌 Smart Home Automation System
A Java-based Smart Home Automation System designed using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates a smart environment where users can remotely monitor and control home devices such as lights, thermostats, and security systems. It features user authentication, role-based access (Admin & Regular User), real-time status updates, event-driven automation, and energy consumption tracking.

🚀 Key Features
Remote ON/OFF control of smart devices

Adjustable device settings (e.g., temperature, brightness)

Scheduled and event-based automation (e.g., motion-triggered lights)

Role-based user management and authentication

Real-time monitoring and logging

Secure data handling with encryption

GUI interface for interaction

Configuration saving/loading (Persistence via File I/O)

🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented
Abstraction: Abstract base classes for users and devices

Inheritance & Polymorphism: Hierarchical device types and user roles

Interfaces: For automation rules and energy monitoring

Method & Constructor Overloading: Including varargs

Nested Classes: For encryption functionality

Exception Handling: Robust handling of user input and I/O

Multithreading: Simulates concurrent monitoring processes

Package Structure: Organized into modular packages for scalability

📁 Technologies Used
